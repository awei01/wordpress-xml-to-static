# Convert Wordpress to Static Site Generator

This is a quick and dirty repository. You can try it and see if it suits your needs, or, hack it to fit your use cases. It takes the `xml` file generated by wordpress's `export` function and converts it to a `jekyll`-like output. Personally, I'm using `metalsmith` to generate my static files.

## Features
* Creates a `data` folder with `authors.yml` and `categories.yml`
* Creates `drafts` folder and `posts` folder with your content. The content has most of the meta data converted to `frontmatter` while `html` is converted to `md` using `turndown`
